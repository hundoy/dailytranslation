ep7_alley	CTS_MIRROR_BROKEN	What... was that?	那……是什么？
ep7_brewery	ARY_INSPECT2	It is signed 'Brighid Laidcend'. Several pages towards the end are missing…	上面著名“布里基德・莱德森德”。日记本的最后几张纸不见了……
ep7_brewery	ARY_INSPECT1	An ornate chest, its inside untouched by the fire. It was probably opened long after the inferno died down. There is a diary inside.	一只装饰华丽的宝箱，内部没有遭到火焰的烤炙。可能是在烈火熄灭很久之后才打开的，里面有一本日记。
ep7_brewery	ECO_TABLE	This table has been upended.	这张桌子被翻了过来。
ep7_brewery	ECO_CORNER	This side of the basement seems to have collapsed during the fire.	地下室的这一侧看上去在火灾中塌方了。
ep7_brewery	ECO_BOTTLES	Remains of the books, scorched by the fire. Most of the pages are ashy or blackened, so the text is illegible.	书的残页被火烧焦了。大部分的书页都化为尘土或是变为焦黑，上面写的字也无法阅读。
ep7_brewery	ARY6	10 October 1801 C Is this the legacy of the Laidcend? I can stand to bear it no longer. Fire will put an end to this blasphemy and cleanse the land of our family's curse. And should the fire prove insufficient, may this testimony serve as warning.	一八一年十月十日 ―― 这就是莱德森德家族的遗产吗？我再也不能忍受了。火焰会把这些渎神之物焚烧殆尽，清除我们家族的诅咒。如果火焰的威力还不够的话，让这份证言作为对后来人的警告吧。
ep7_brewery	ARY5	25 September 1801 C The abbey was in such a state of decay that it was nearly impossible to find the mural painting in the dark. Fortunately, a dim light happened to shine through a gap in a wall, illuminating the face of the Sentinel. ?
?
I believe Aunt Máire's iron disc is needed to open the secret passage.	一八一年九月二十五日 ―― 修道院已经腐朽得不成样子，几乎不可能在黑暗中找到那幅壁画。幸运的是，墙上的孔洞中透出了一丝昏暗的灯光，照亮了哨兵的面庞。?
?
我相信玛丽阿姨的铁质碟子是打开密道的关键。
ep7_brewery	ARY4	The damnable place that she speaks of… I must know if it really exists. I am resolved to investigate our family's crypt. It would be prudent to wait until dusk before traveling to the Northern Cape, so as to not be seen.	她所说的那个恶劣的地方……我必须查明它是否真实存在。我已经决心彻底调查我们家族的地下室。以防万一，要等到黄昏之后再动身去北海角，这样不会被人发现。
ep7_brewery	ARY3	23 September 1801 C I found Aunt Máire's diaries next to an odd iron disc. But the contents of the diaries were appalling. What could have happened that dear old Máire would write such things?	一八一年九月二十三日 ―― 我在一只奇怪的铁质碟子边找到了玛丽阿姨的日记。但是日记的内容令人震惊。亲爱的老玛丽究竟经历了什么才会写下这种东西？
ep7_brewery	ARY2	10 September 1801 C I would not have thought to find such a remarkable library hidden away in the basement. It includes several magnificent tomes on the most picturesque customs of our land.	一八一年九月十日 ―― 我从未预料到在地下室会有如此卓越的图书馆，里面存放着数册精美的古籍，上面记录了这座岛上最为生动形象的风俗。
ep7_brewery	ARY1	7 August 1801 C Words cannot express the gratitude that I feel for Aunt Máire's bequest―may her dear soul rest in peace. This house is just what I needed to still my nerves after the exhausting pace of life in Dublin.	一八一年八月七日 ―― 我对于玛丽阿姨馈赠的感激之情不能用言语表达――希望她的在天之灵安息。这座房子就是我从都柏林快节奏生活退隐之后最好的休息场所。

ep7_alley	BTS_ROOF	No matter the strength of structure, all things succumb to time. But whether it was the ages or something else that ravaged this place, I cannot say.	无论建筑的结构有多么坚固，一切都会在岁月的磨砺下屈服。但是我不能确定究竟是时光还是其他东西蹂躏了这个地方。

ep7_alley	UMBRELLA2_INSPECT	The water is so muddy that I can barely see the bottom of the trough.	泥水非常浑浊，看不清水槽底部。

ep7_burntHouseExt	MAILBOX_OPEN_INSPECT	There is nothing else here.	这里没有其它东西了。
ep7_brewery	ARY_AFTER_INSPECT	Miss Laidcend must have found something abhorrent in her family's crypt. If I could find out what it was, I may learn more about the Cronemeadan. My intuition tells me that I must act tonight or else it will be too late.	莱德森德小姐一定是在家族地宫中找到了一些令人生厌的东西。如果我能调查出那是什么，我可能会更加了解望盈朔。我的直觉告诉我一定要在今晚行动，不然就太晚了。
ep7_brewery	CTS_BREWERY_FIRST_TIME	I think this basement might have once housed a library. It looks like it was not burned as badly as the rest of the house. Even so, little here remains intact.	我想这间地下室一定容纳了一个图书馆。看上去它受火灾的毁坏比屋子的其它地方少多了。尽管如此，这里的东西也很少完好无缺。
ep7_brewery	BTS_BED	It looks like some sort of makeshift bed, was kieran sleeping in this terrible lonely place?	这看上去是一张临时的床，难道基兰在这个可怕、孤寂的地方睡过觉吗？

ep7_lightHouseExt	ECO_DRYTREE	This tree looks like it has been dead for a long time.	看上去这棵树枯了很久了。

ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_18	You say you had an accident? What happened?	你说发生了一次事故？发生什么了？
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_20_CH	And the lamp has not been fixed since?	从这以后灯就再也没有修好过？
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_20	Has nobody else tried to fix the lamp since?	从这之后就没有人修理过这盏灯了吗？
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_21	No, no one in the village is interested. For them, the more isolated éilís Mór is, the better. They do not care about ships or accidents, especially Lord Donnán. He sees anything coming from outside of the island as a threat.	不，村里没有人对此有任何兴趣。对他们来说，大埃利斯岛越与世隔绝越好。他们毫不关心过往船只的安全，尤其是多南领主。他把来自岛外的一切事物视为威胁。
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_13_CH	Do you know Lord Donnán?	你认识多南领主吗？
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_13	Do you know Lord Donnán personally?	你和多南领主有私交吗？
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_LIGHTROOM_DOOR5	Yes, yes. You already has my permission.	是的，是的。我允许你上去了。
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_22	Naturally! The Donnán family has ruled éilís Mór for generations.	当然了！多南家族几代以来都统治着大埃利斯岛。
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_23_CH	I would like to visit the lightroom anyway.	无论如何我都要去看一眼灯具室。
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_23	Might I go upstairs and see the lightroom? Even though the lamp is off, I should like to take a view of the surrounding countryside.	我能上楼看一眼灯具室吗？虽然灯关着，但是我还想看看周围的乡村风光。
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_24	Well, I do not think you will see anything, really. But if you are so interested... Yes, I guess you may.	嗯，我不觉得你会看到什么，真的。但如果你这么感兴趣的话……好的，去吧。

ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_31	You don't know how grateful I am. For years I've longed to hear those marvelous sounds.	我对你的感激之情无以复加，这么多年来我对着美妙的乐音梦寐以求。

ep7_lightHouseExt	WICKERMAN_LIGHTHOUSEEXT_FLOOR	Good Lord!	天哪！
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_6_CH	I am visiting the island.	我是来游览这座岛的。
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_5_CH	I got lost.	我迷路了。
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_12_CH	Why is the lamp not lit?	为什么灯塔没有点亮？
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_10	If you stand at the apex of that hill, over there, past the rocks, you will see the lights of the village.	如果你站在那座山的山顶上，就在那里，越过礁石，就能看到村庄的灯火。
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_9	I understand. After sunset, the hills of éilís Mór can be tricky. We have a saying here: 'In dusk, all paths change'.	我理解。日落后，大埃利斯岛的山路走起来很困难。我们当地人有句俗话：“黄昏将近，阡陌易途”。
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_5	I was taking a stroll, and I fear I got lost.	我是在四处探访，然后恐怕迷路了。
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_8	Well, it's not. Even though I can barely see a thing, this is my house.	好吧，它没有被遗弃。尽管我几乎什么都看不见，但这还是我的住所。
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_7	And since it's dark, you thought it to be abandoned?	因为灯塔没有发光，所以你就觉得它被遗弃了吗？
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_6	I am a visitor to éilís Mór. This lighthouse caught my eye.	我是到大埃利斯岛的一名游客。这座灯塔吸引了我的注意。

ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER1	Good evening. Would you happen to be the lighthouse keeper?	晚上好。你就是灯塔看守吗？

ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_44	Well, I’ll admit I’m not sure what happened to the boy... But one thing I'm sure of, this 'Festival of Reunion' is nothing but a farce. And it would be just so easy to prove it...	好吧，我承认我不知道那个男孩怎么了……但是我很确定一件事，这个所谓的“重逢节”纯属一场闹剧。证明我的观点易如反掌……
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_41	What of Kieran's disappearance, then?	那么，基兰的失踪又如何解释呢？
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_41_CH	What of Kieran's disappearance?	基兰的失踪又如何解释呢？
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_51	Exactly! What do you think would happen if you unburied them mirrors? That a band of goblins would come out of the marshes to steal them? Nothing but nonsense.	就是这样！你觉得如果把镜子挖出来会怎么样？一群哥布林会从沼泽里冒出来偷走镜子？荒谬，荒谬至极。
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_50	Well, I did see a group of people in the village burying mirrors.	没错，我的确见过村子里的一群人在埋镜子。
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_49	But sure it’s all nonsense! Look, it’s really easy to prove it all wrong: just don’t follow the rituals. You’re a stranger to our ways, but have you seen any of the things I mentioned?	但这一切都是胡扯！其实很容易就能证明这一切都是错误的：不要进行所谓的仪式。你对于我们的传统还很陌生，但是你一定见过我提到的种种现象吧？
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_48	Look, folks here are too gullible, they’ll do anything to protect themselves from their strange fears. They’ll not eat corn, nor drink milk, or they'll dig graves for their mirrors. And of course, they’ll avoid standing near a fearnóg too long because, though the fiends cannot touch the tree, they're attracted to the smell of its resin.	你看，这里的村民十分轻信流言，他们会不顾一切保护自己，不受他们奇特的恐惧侵扰。他们不吃谷物，不喝牛奶，或者把镜子埋在地底。当然，他们不会站在水清风下太久，因为他们认为即使恶魔无法触碰这种树，也会被它的树脂的香气吸引。
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_47	What do you mean?	你是什么意思？
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_46	I just find it a bit suspicious that it happened so close to the Reunion. It’s too easy to be keeping secrets during the festival, being how everyone is afraid of leaving the village those nights.	如此临近重逢仪式的关头，基兰突然失踪了，我觉得很可疑。节日期间有什么秘密再简单不过了，因为现在大家都不敢在晚上离开村子。
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_45	A tragedy, it was. A strange one, but a tragedy nonetheless.	没错，那真是个悲剧。十分奇异的一场悲剧，但至始至终都是悲剧。
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_39	Do you know anything about the disappearance of Lord Donnán's son?	你知道多南领主之子失踪的来龙去脉吗？
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_39_CH	Kieran's disappearance.	基兰的失踪。
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_37	What was so strange about Kieran's disappearance?	基兰的失踪有什么奇怪的？
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_37_CH	Kieran's disappearance was strange?	基兰的失踪经过很奇怪吗？
ep7_lightHouseInt	MAYBE_ASK	Maybe I could persuade him to allow me up there...	说不定我能说服他让我上去看看……
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_12	Why is the lighthouse lamp not lit? Is it not dangerous for the ships?	为什么没有点亮灯塔？这对于来往的船只不是很危险吗？
ep7_lightRoom	BUTTON_OFF_INSPECT	This switch seems to be related to the lighthouse's electric lamp.	这个开关似乎能操控灯塔的电灯。

ep7_lightRoom	MACHINE_FIXED	The cog was the missing piece of the mechanism. It has been replaced and the mechanism has been well oiled. It was easy to wind and now it is back to life!	齿轮就是整个机械缺失的一部分。现在齿轮被放了回去，润滑油也涂好了。整部机械转起来很容易，焕发着新生命！
ep7_lightRoom	ONLY_OIL_APPLIED	The mechanism has been thoroughly oiled, but something is still missing.	机械完全涂上了润滑油，但是还缺少什么东西。
ep7_lightRoom	MACHINE_BROKEN	The clockwork mechanism that causes the lamp's reflector to spin. However, I think that something is missing. It could do with some oiling as well.	发条装置可以使灯具的反射镜转动起来。但是我觉得似乎缺了什么东西。发条也需要上一点油。
ep7_lighthouseTree	LIGHTHOUSEKEEPER_INSPECT_2	There is a dim light inside.	里面有一丝昏暗的灯光。
ep7_lighthouseTree	WCB_CONTANIER_LIGHTHOUSETREE	I would rather leave it intact.	我最好让它保持完整。

ep7_lighthouseTree	LIGHTHOUSE_DOOR_OPEN	It sounds like it attracted someone's attention downstairs.	看上去楼下的某个人注意到了响声。
ep7_lighthouseTree	LIGHTHOUSEKEEPER_ABSENT_INSPECT	There is a dim light inside.	里面有一丝昏暗的灯光。
ep7_lighthouseTree	LIGHTHOUSEKEEPER_INSPECT	Someone is inside! Maybe I could make some kind of noise to attract their attention.	有人在灯塔里！说不定我能弄出点声音吸引他的注意。
ep7_lighthouseTree	GONG_INSPECT	Maybe by making some noise, I will be able to attract the attention of the person inside the lighthouse.	说不定我弄出点响声，就能吸引灯塔里的人的注意力。
ep7_lighthouseTree	LIGHTHOUSETREE_INSPECT	A wide copper pipe runs from the tower to the ground. It is covered in salt and seaweed.	一根粗铜管从塔顶通到地面。上面布满了海盐和海藻。
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_18_CH	An accident?	是事故吗？
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_19	I was checking the lenses, because the failure looked so very strange and I was worried. All of a sudden, the light must have gone on; I was blinded and can see nothing but fleeting shapes ever since.	因为这次故障很奇怪，我很担心，于是我检查了灯具的透镜组。突然，灯打开了；我被光芒刺中了眼，从此之后只能看见模糊的影子。
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_17	Precisely that. One stormy afternoon, I suddenly heard a strong noise up in the lightroom. The clockwork mechanism had stopped working and the lamp was off! I had never seen a failure like that. I could not get the lighthouse working again.	一点没错。一个狂风暴雨的下午，我听见灯具室里传来一声巨响。发条机械停工了，灯也灭了！我之前从未见过那样的故障。我倾尽全力也无法恢复灯塔运作。

ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_16_CH	Was there a failure in the mechanism?	是机械故障吗？
ep7_lightHouseInt	LG_KEEPER_14	Do not let it concern you―many years ago, the sea lanes were altered to avoid this coast. Now it's rare indeed to see a ship in these waters. After the accident, the lighthouse was never repaired.	不要担心――很多年前，海路就已经改道，避开这片滩涂。现在，在这片海域已经很少看到有船经过了。在那次事故后，灯塔也从未有人修理过。
ep7_lightRoom	BUTTON_ON_INSPECT	The lamp is on.	灯打开了。
ep7_lightRoom	BATTERYPOST_INSPECT	It looks like the lighthouse's electric lamp battery slot.	这像是灯塔电灯的电池孔。

ep7_rocksHill	LG_DRAWING_OPTION_1_2	That's the burrow of the hill. That one up there. But you can’t get too close. The Crooked One sleeps at the bottom.	那是山上的洞穴。上面的那个。但是你不要太靠近它。驼背人沉睡在洞穴深处。
ep7_rocksHill	LG_DRAWING_OPTION_2_1	Is this the village?	这就是那座村庄吗？
ep7_rocksHill	LG_DRAWING_OPTION_2_2	Yes, and the fearnóg tree in the graveyard. That tree gives me the chills these nights. On Reunion they got them little lanterns on it and they look like evil eyes staring into you.	是的，还有坟场里的那棵水清风。那棵树在夜晚使我背脊发凉。在重逢节，上面会挂上小灯笼，看上去就像恶灵的眼睛直瞪着你。
ep7_rocksHill	LG_DRAWING_OPTION_3_1	What about these buildings?	那么这些建筑呢？
ep7_rocksHill	LG_TAW_ROCKSHILL_1	The marsh in this valley is, for simpletons, a wellspring of frightful tales.	对于那些头脑简单的人来说，村子里的沼泽有一系列骇人的传说。
ep7_rocksHill	LG_TAW_ROCKSHILL_4	The educated among us enjoy the tales as little more than distractions, knowing us safe from those visions. We know these stories to be nothing but superstition.	我们中的读书人把这些传闻仅仅当作消遣，知道这些幻象与我们无关。我们听这些故事只是当成迷信故事听的。
ep7_rocksHill	LG_TAW_ROCKSHILL_5	But how can we be so sure that in the dense mist that eminates from the stagnant water, we may not find passages to other worlds?	但是你怎么能确定这潭死水中散发的厚重迷雾中没有通向其它世界的通道呢？
ep7_rocksHill	LG_TAW_ROCKSHILL_6	What if the wails that drift from the reeds in the darkest of nights are the songs of those from our worst nightmares?	如果暗夜里芦苇丛中传来的歌声，来自于我们最可怕的噩梦中的存在呢？
ep7_rocksHill	LG_ARTISTKID21_CH	The marsh dwellers.	沼泽行者。
ep7_rocksHill	LG_ARTISTKID21	The marsh dwellers? Who are they?	沼泽行者？他们是谁？
ep7_rocksHill	LG_ARTISTKID22	They’re scary. My Aunt Kathleen says they were real bad people. You’d never see them, but you’d hear them in the reeds. They try to take you in there with them.	他们很可怕。我的婶婶凯瑟琳说他们是很坏的人。你不会看见他们，但是你能听见他们在芦苇丛中歌唱。他们会尝试把你拖进去。
ep7_rocksHill	LG_ARTISTKID24	That? It's a map that Kieran made.	那个？那是一张基兰画的地图。
ep7_rocksHill	LG_ARTISTKID25	So it is a map…	那么这的确是一张地图……
ep7_rocksHill	LG_ARTISTKID26	The drawing is Kieran's? There could be a clue here of his whereabouts…	这是基兰画的？这可能隐含着他去向的线索……
ep7_rocksHill	LG_ARTISTKID27_CH	Did you know Kieran?	你认识基兰吗？
ep7_rocksHill	LG_ARTISTKID27	Were you Kieran's friend?	你是基兰的朋友吗？
ep7_rocksHill	LG_ARTISTKID28	He was nice, but he didn’t want to play much. He was mostly for going in the hills by himself.	他是个好人，但是他不经常和我们玩。他大部分时间都一个人在山里。
ep7_rocksHill	LG_ARTISTKID29_CH	Was Kieran not afraid?	基兰不害怕吗？
ep7_rocksHill	LG_ARTISTKID29	Was Kieran not scared of the marsh dwellers?	基兰不怕那些沼泽行者吗？
ep7_ruinedChapel	ECO_SUN	This symbol looks familiar. A spiked circle… It could be the sun.	这个符号看上去很熟悉，带刺的圆环……可能是太阳。
ep7_ruinedChapel	ECO_VIRGIN	A statue of a Madonna. But something is off. I cannot tell what it is.	一尊圣母玛利亚的雕像。但缺了什么东西。我看不出缺了什么。
ep7_rocksHill	LG_BURNTHOUSE6	That's the Crooked One.	那是驼背人。
ep7_rocksHill	LG_ARTISTKID11	Hello. My name is Wakefield.	你好。我的名字叫威克菲尔德。
ep7_rocksHill	LG_BURNTHOUSE1	What is this?	这是什么？

ep7_rocksHill	LG_ARTISTKID4	I found this drawing at the school. Is it yours?	我在学校找到了这幅画，是你画的吗？
ep7_rocksHill	LG_ARTISTKID7_CH	About this drawing…	关于这幅画……

ep7_rocksHill	LG_ARTISTKID2_1	Excuse me?	不好意思？
ep7_rocksHill	ECO_PICTURE_GROUND	It is a drawing of some sort of spiked circle. Is it the sun, or something else?	这是一个带刺圆环的图案。这是太阳还是别的什么东西？
ep7_rocksHill	LG_ARTISTKID36	He took it from the old house in the hills. Maybe the marsh dwellers wanted it.	基兰把它从山上的老屋里带了出来，可能沼泽行者想要它。
ep7_rocksHill	STICK2_INSPECT	The child that I spoke with earlier seems to have left his mask here.	我之前和他聊过的孩子似乎把他的面具落在这里了。
ep7_rocksHill	STICK_INSPECT	The child that I spoke with earlier seems to have left his mask here.	我之前和他聊过的孩子似乎把他的面具落在这里了。
ep7_rocksHill	LG_ARTISTKID35	That's why we can't come here alone. We always has to take someone with us.	这就是我们不独自来这里的原因。我们总要结伴同行。
ep7_rocksHill	LG_ARTISTKID33	Yes, for sure. Before he disappeared he said he found a treasure, a disc with a beautiful drawing.	是的，没错。他在失踪前宣称找到了一件宝藏，一张画着精美图案的碟子。
ep7_rocksHill	LG_ARTISTKID32	You think the marsh dwellers took him?	你认为沼泽行者带走了他？
ep7_rocksHill	LG_ARTISTKID31	No, he said he had seen them and that they were not that scary as Aunt says. I think that is why they took him.	不，他说他见过那些沼泽行者，他们没有婶婶说的那么可怕。我觉得这就是他们把基兰带走的原因。
ep7_rocksHill	LG_BURNTHOUSE15	It is the house from Kieran's picture, the one that the Crooked One burned with its breath.	这是基兰图画上画的房子，就是被驼背人吐息烧毁的那一栋。
ep7_ruinedChapel	CHAPEL_FIRST_TIME	This seems like some sort of chapel, but Christian symbols are scarce.	这看上去像某种教堂，但是几乎没有基督教的符号。
ep7_school	BIN_INSPECT	A trash bin filled with papers. There is a drawing on one.	一个塞满了纸张的垃圾桶。其中一张上面有一幅画。
ep7_school	BIN_INSPECT2	There is nothing else of interest.	这里没有什么值得看的东西。
ep7_school	BIN_REACT	It is a child's drawing. There seems to be a village, a lake, and some sort of creature.	这是一个孩子的图画。上面有一座村庄，一片湖，和某种生物。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_26_CH	Tell me about Kieran.	告诉我基兰的事。
ep7_school	ESK_INSPECT	A paper with black circles painted on it.	一张画着黑圈的纸。
ep7_school	OOR_SCHOOL_GRAVEYARD_LOCKED	Locked.	锁着。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_1	Good evening. To what do I owe the pleasure? I am a busy woman, as you can see.	晚上好。什么风把你吹来了？如你所见，我可是很忙的。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_2	My name is Dr Wakefield. I have come to éilís Mór to rest for a while. Lord Donnán said that I might find you here.	我是威克菲尔德医生。我来大埃利斯岛上休憩一段时间。多南领主说我能在这里找到你。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_3	Have you met Lord Donnán? It has been so long since I have seen him here in the village. I hope he is well.	你见过多南领主了吗？上次在村子里见到他已经是很久之前的事了。我希望他一切还好。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_9_CH	Lord Donnán.	多南领主。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_9	So you have not seen Lord Donnán lately?	你最近没有见到多南领主？
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_7	We all searched the island, but… he was nowhere to be found.	我们搜遍了小岛，但是……根本找不到他的影子。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_10	As far as I know, no one has seen him since... well, it's been a few weeks. Now that the festival has started, maybe he'll be motivated to join us in the village.	据我所知，自从……好吧，几个星期前就没有人见过他。现在重逢节开始了，说不定他会来村子里助兴。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_11_CH	Ask about the Cronemeadan.	询问望盈朔的相关信息。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_11	Might I ask you a question, Miss Foster?	我能问你一个问题吗，佛斯特女士？
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_13	What can you tell me about this curious festival?	关于这个奇特的节日，你知道多少？
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_13_CH	Festival of Reunion.	重聚节。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_14	Well, it takes place when the constellation Reunion is visible in the sky. On those nights, dark things and spirits ride the winds that travel across the hills. As you may have already seen, at sunset the villagers don masks. They do this so that the spirits will not know them or carry them away to the depths of their underground caves.	是的，当天空中重逢的星座闪耀之时，就是重聚节开始之日。在这些夜晚，黑暗之物与魂灵骑乘着狂风在山间驰骋。如你所见，日落之后，村民们都戴上了面具。他们这样做是为了防止魂灵们认出他们，把他们挟持到魂灵的地下洞穴之中。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_19_CH	I must go.	我该走了。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_19	I must leave now. It has been a pleasure.	我现在该走了。和你谈话很高兴。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_20	The pleasure was mine. Enjoy your time on éilís Mór.	我应该高兴才是。祝你在大埃利斯岛上玩得开心。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_45	Céad míle fáilte, Dr Wakefield. Welcome to éilís Mór.	别来无恙，威克菲尔德医生。欢迎来到大埃利斯岛。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_22_CH	What happened?	发生什么了？
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_22	Did something happen a few weeks ago?	几周前发生了什么？
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_24	Oh, sure it was only terrible. Kieran, his only child, disappeared without a trace. He went off to play in the hills and just... vanished. No one has seen him since.	哦，当然很可怕了。基兰，他的独生子，没有留下任何线索就失踪了。他去山上玩，然后就……消失了。从那之后没人再见过他。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_30	Good Lord. And you say he has not been found yet? How is that possible?	天哪。你说他还没被找到？这怎么可能？
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_26	What can you tell me about Kieran's disappearance?	关于基兰的失踪你又知道多少？
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_27	Just that he was a restless child who loved exploring deserted areas. You might learn more from his classmates.	他是一个好动的孩子，喜欢探索了无人烟的地方。你可以问问他的同学。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_46	His desk was in the back corner.	他的课桌在教室角落。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_31	Yes, of course.	是的，当然。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_32	Do you know the meaning of the word 'Cronemeadan'?	你知道“望盈朔”是什么意思吗？
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_33	Yes… It's a very unusual word. Very much indeed.	是的……那是一个很特殊的词。十分特殊。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_34	The Cronemeadan is the sanctuary of the Crooked One. It is a cursed place, the dwelling of the Devil. I recall it from the tales that I heard as a child. Of course, our elders only made up those tales to scare us and protect us from harm.	望盈朔是驼背人的圣堂。这个地方受到了诅咒，是魔鬼的处所。我童年时听到过这个传说。当然，这些传说都是长辈们为了吓我们，不让我们去危险的地方捏造出来的。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_51	Lord Donnán said you are an expert on the island's folklore.	多南领主说你是岛上民俗的专家。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_48	But a few nights later, the Laidcend house was consumed in a horrific blaze, putting an end to the old family.	但是几天后的一个夜晚，莱德森德的家宅被可怕的烈焰吞噬了，终结了这个古老的家族。

ep7_schoolSt	BIKE_WHEEL2_INSPECT	It looks like the wheel has been lying here for a long time.	看上去这只轮子在这里放了很久了。
ep7_schoolSt	BIKE_WHEEL_REACT	Based on the cog's workmanship, it looks like it was part of a complex industrial mechanism. But someone has tried to fit it crudely onto that broken bicycle wheel. How on Earth did it come to be in a village like this?	根据齿轮的做工，看上去是一套复杂工业机械的一部分。但是有人把它强行装在了坏掉的自行车轮上。这只齿轮是怎么到这样的村庄的？
ep7_schoolSt	BIKE_WHEEL_INSPECT	An abandoned wheel. A peculiar cog is attached to it.	一个被废弃的轮子，上面装着一只奇特的齿轮。
ep7_schoolSt	SCHOOL_DOOR_LOCKED	The door is locked.	门锁着。
ep7_school	CTS_MIRROR_BROKEN	What... was that?	那……是什么？
ep7_school	BTS_PICTURE_SCHOOL	A picture of a slender woman, apparently a goddess, wearing a black dress and having a murder of crows around her. It's signed with a name: "Badb Catha".	一个消瘦女人的图片，明显是一位女神，身着黑裙，身边围绕着一群乌鸦。上面写着名字：“战鸦”。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_PICTURE4	Things that were familiar to him, the village, his home... but these other shapes... I do not know. You could ask one of his class mates, they should be able to tell you more about it.	对他熟悉的东西：村庄、他的家……但是其他形状……我不知道。你可以问问他的同学他们应该可以告诉你更多信息。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_PICTURE3	What would you say it represents?	你认为它代表什么？
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_PICTURE2	Yes... This was painted by poor Kieran.	是的……这是可怜的基兰画的。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_PICTURE_1	I found this picture. Was it made by one of your students?	我找到了这张画，是不是你的学生画的？
ep7_school	ESK_REACT	There is some kind of worm drive inside, the remains of an insect and some drawings engraved on the desk. I will take the drive with me, it may prove itself useful.	里面有一根蜗杆和昆虫的残骸，桌上刻着一些图案。我要带上螺杆，说不定会有用。
ep7_school	ECO_BLACKBOARD	'They'll dance around the burrow,?
Around the burrow they'll sing.?
It's cold inside as winter.?
Don't get too close!?
Don't get too close!?
Or else they'll pull you in.'	“他们在洞口边舞蹈，?
在洞口边歌唱。?
里面如严冬一般寒冷。?
不要靠太近！?
不要靠太近！?
不然他们就会把你拉进去。”
ep7_school	ECO_BOOKSHELF	A shelf of handmade books with unfamiliar titles. Most of them concern strange rites.	书架上放着许多标题陌生的手制书籍。很多书都描写了奇特的仪式。
ep7_school	ECO_WINDOWS	The windows are open, letting a chilly draft inside.	窗户开着，一丝冷风吹了进来。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_52	He said that, did he? Well I wouldn’t call myself an expert, now, but I’ve lived here in éilís Mór longer than most. And I’ve heard my fair share of stories about the Other Side and its people.	他的确这么说了，是吗？当然，现在我还不能自称为专家，但是我比大多数人住在大埃利斯岛上的时间长。我也听过不少关于另一侧世界及其居民的故事。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_51_CH	éilís Mór's traditions.	大埃利斯岛的传统。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_44	Yes, that was one of the first rites of the Reunion, a very important one. As I said, people dress up to protect themselves from those that will come. But this is not enough. Since the mirrors they have looked into while changing know their identities, they bury them next to the old fearnóg. The roots of this tree grow in both worlds at the same time, so they keep the witness mirrors safe.	是的，那是重聚节起始的仪式之一，十分重要。正如我所说，人们穿上奇装异服保护自己不受即将到来的东西的伤害。但这还不够。因为他们照的镜子知道他们的真实身份，他们就把镜子埋在老水清风树下。这棵树的根系连接阴阳两界，维护了镜子的安全。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_43	There was a group of masked people at the graveyard. Was that part of the festival?	坟场里有一群带着面具的人。那是节日的一部分吗？
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_43_CH	People at the graveyard.	坟场里的人。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_47	It is general knowledge that beings from the Other Side detest iron, so the cursing and the shouting of the young Laidcend received no immediate answer.	众所周知，另一侧的存在厌恶铁器，所以年轻的莱德森德的诅咒与喊叫没有立刻得到答复。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_41	It is said that the last heir of the Laidcend once defied the Crooked One by approaching the rim with an iron amulet in her hand.	据说莱德森德家族的最后一名继承人曾经手持一个铁质护身符接近洞口，冒犯了驼背人。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_40	Long ago, our ancestors threw livestock into the pit in the hope of placating the Crooked One's hunger. Though that tradition has not been practiced for some time, so perhaps it would be best if you did not approach the hole.	很久之前，我们的祖先向洞里投放牲畜来满足驼背人的食欲。因为这种传统已经断绝很久了，所以可能最好不要接近洞口。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_39	Folks around here believe there lies an old serpent at its depths C ravenous for flesh. The Crooked One.	附近的村民相信洞穴深处有一条老蟒蛇――渴望人肉。那就是驼背人。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_38	There’s a hole in the ground up in the hills, not too far from the village. A hole so dark and deep, you’d not see the end.	离村子不远的山上有一个洞穴，深不见底，黑暗无边。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_37	All right.	好的。
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_36	Would you tell me the story of the Cronemeadan?	你能告诉我望盈朔的故事吗？
ep7_school	LG_TEACHER_36_CH	Please tell me the story.	请把这个故事讲给我听。

ep7_veil	LG_DEVITT_6	No, you should not be here.	不，你不应该在这里出现的。
ep7_wellSt	GRAVEYARD_LOCKED	The gate leads to the village graveyard. It is closed and locked.	这道大门通向村庄里的坟场。大门紧紧关上并且锁住了。
ep7_veil	LG_DEVITT_5	No.	不。
ep7_veil	LG_DEVITT_4	What are you...	你在……什么？
ep7_veil	LG_DEVITT_3	Doctor... Wakefield?	威克菲尔德……医生？
ep7_veil	LG_DEVITT_2	Devitt?	戴维特？
ep7_veil	LG_DEVITT_1	...	……

I had to find Jeremiah Devitt.	为了纪念我的朋友，我必须继续寻找。?

ep7_cemetery	FT_CEMETERY_4	Lieber Wakefield,?
?
I write this letter in my last moments of lucidity. I have not received word from you since I regained consciousness, but I am confident that you will soon return with information that is crucial to our investigation. The bravery that you demonstrated in the face of these latest discoveries is worthy of my most sincere admiration.	亲爱的威克菲尔德：?
?
我正在竭尽最后一丝清醒神智给你写这封信。我恢复意识之后还没有听到你的消息，但我相信你一定能得到至关紧要的信息。你在最近几次探险中展现出的勇气值得我最崇高的敬意。
ep7_cemetery	FT_CEMETERY_4_1	I must now ask you for yet more courage. The doctors were unable to determine the cause of my sudden illness, nor have they found a cure. I have not much time left. My greatest regret is that I must abandon you to the difficult tasks that lie ahead. I implore you to persevere, now that we are so close to finding an answer.	我现在不得不要求你更加勇敢。医师们无法确定我突发疾病的病因，也没有找到任何治疗方法。我的时间不多了。我最大的遗憾就是留下你一个人面对前路上重重的考验。我恳求你，在这个如此接近真相的关头，坚持下去。
ep7_cemetery	FT_CEMETERY_4_2	The Professor's documents were filled with references to a place of dark legend: the Cronemeadan, an ancient sanctuary on the island of éllís Mór. The exact location of the Cronemeadan has been lost, but the Professor believed that its secrets may explain why his experiments met with such disastrous results. You must find this place, mein Freund.?
?
I do not need to remind you to exercise the uttermost discretion. I have complete trust in you.	教授的文档中全部记载着一个黑暗传奇的描述：望盈朔，这座大埃利斯岛上的古老圣堂。望盈朔的确切位置已经散佚了，但是教授坚信它的秘密能解释他的实验为何会产生如此灾难性的后果。你必须找到这个地方，我的朋友。?
?
我已不必再提醒你一定要把自己的行动绝对保密了。我对你的信任无以复加。

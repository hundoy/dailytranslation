We must keep ourselves safe... and our patients too, of course.</string>

But there was something strange about him, wasn't there? I believe it scared some of the other patients. You never know, with this lot. I'm sorry that I can't remember much... there have been so many people here... it is hard to keep track.</string>
      <string id="DLG_HALL_06">Have you worked here for long?</string>
      <string id="DLG_HALL_07">Yes, a long time. I can scarcely remember how many years. Time goes slowly in here, and the isolation… The rules don't allow us to leave. I don't know what is happening in the world anymore. But we have our duty, do we not? Who else will care for our patients?</string>
      <string id="DLG_HALL_08">May I request access to the institute's archives? There should be some information there about the man I am looking for, Mr. Du Pré.</string>
      <string id="DLG_HALL_09">I am sorry, Doctor, but the archives are private. We must not allow anyone to access them without the proper authority. Many of our patients come from good families, you see, and we take great care to respect their privacy. But do not look so crestfallen. You would not find much in any case. It is a long time since they have been organised.</string>

      <string id="PREVIOUSLY_3">在调查的过程中，他被注射了他们学生时代曾经用过的一种血清，由于血清的作用，大卫的精神徘徊在梦境般的帷幕之中长达数个小时。在那里，他遇到了他的老同学亚历山大·杜普雷，亚历山大怂恿大卫加入他的研究中来，带他一同穿过处于鸟之眼监视的区域。</string>
      <string id="PREVIOUSLY_4">当大卫从昏迷中苏醒，他发现自己被他朋友的说辞说服。于是他来到了亚历山大·杜普雷的宅邸，发现他的朋友已经给自己注射了一种改良的血清，只留下一具谵妄的躯壳。新的血清能将精神永久地留在帷幕并穿越帷幕。</string>
      <string id="PREVIOUSLY_5">最后，大卫发现了一小瓶血清，并注射了它。在帷幕之中，他再次见到了他的朋友，并且共同穿过了最后一扇门，进入到了对人眼来说可谓禁忌的另一个世界。</string>

September 25, 1891.

Mr. Roan's condition has degenerated since the last session. He is restless, as if the morphine had no effect on him. For the last week he has been obsessive, troubled for reasons unknown.</string>
      <string id="WALL_CLIPPINGS_TEXT_2">September 29, 1891.

Dr. Wedall has been attacked and bitten in the face. Four men were needed to subdue the patient, Mr. Roan. Three markings were found on his body upon examination. Self-harm is a possible cause.</string>
      <string id="WALL_CLIPPINGS_TEXT_3">October 3, 1891.

Mr. Roan is getting better day by day, both physically and mentally. His habits have changed considerably. He now shows an interest in religion and spends his time murmuring prayers, albeit ones unknown to my colleagues and me.</string>
      <string id="INSPECT_MAD_STATE0">Dark as the room is now, I can see through the false mirror. There is a man on the other side, heavily restrained, desperately trying to free himself. He has an expression of unbearable horror on his face.</string>
      <string id="INSPECT_MAD_STATE1">A man is sitting in the corner, looking in my direction with a cold, unemotional gaze.</string>
      <string id="INSPECT_MAD_STATE2">A man is striking the glass strongly with his fist. His expression is of pure hate. I don't think he can see me, but I feel that, somehow, he knows I'm here.</string>

      <string id="DLG_15_04_04">Have you ever heard the name "Jeremiah Devitt"?</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_04_03">Someone has disappeared.</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_22">A patient of mine has disappeared. Alexandre is the only one that may know his whereabouts.</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_23">Have you ever heard the name "Jeremiah Devitt"? I must find him.</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_24">If it is true that Du Pré is involved in your patient's disappearance, then I am afraid the matter is out of my reach. Yours too. Now, please leave me alone.</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_25">Devitt… No, I have not.</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_31">I found your medal. It was in a house on Paul Street, door 26. You were there, right?</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_32">You think you know what you are doing, but you cannot imagine what you are getting into. I am asking you for the last time: leave and forget this matter.</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_33">I will not leave until I find the answers I am seeking. Tell me what I want to know.</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_34">You fool…</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_35">…That's… Ah, for the Devil's sake! Alright, if you want to ruin your life you are free to do it!</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_35_04">What do you mean "activities"?</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_35_03">Tell me about 26 Paul Street.</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_35_02">Do you know why he was interested in your story?</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_35_01">How did you meet Mr. Du Pré?</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_35_00">What really happened on Majuba Hill?</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_37">What really happened on Majuba Hill? Sergeant Conghill told me the story, but his details were... confusing.</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_38">I will never be able to forget that day. Nobody knew what really happened. Command decided that we must have been ambushed. Now I know better. There was something in that fog. Something that did not like us entering its domain. A... sentinel of some sort. That thing is what killed my soldiers.</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_39">How did you meet Alexandre Du Pré?</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_40">I was in the veterans' hospital recovering from an illness unknown to the physicians. An ailment of the soul. Du Pré managed to contact me there. He wanted to know my version of the story, what had happened to me in the Battle of Majuba Hill.</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_43">Do you know why was he so interested in your story?</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_44">I did not know immediately, but with time, I realised. The truth about what happened to me was important to his activities, as was I myself. But if you think he tricked me, you could not be more wrong. I wanted to enter the dragon's mouth. I burned with a need to know.</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_46">Inside that house I saw a machine, still operating. What was that?</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_47">A... machine? I do not know what you are talking about. That was just one of many places used as a base for Alexandre's activities. The only one whose location I was allowed to know.</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_49">What was Mr. Du Pré doing then?</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_50">You really do not know, do you? Have you ever heard of the Playwright?</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_51_00">I have never heard that before.</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_51_01">Yes, I have heard of it before.</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_52">I do not know what that is.</string>
      <string id="DLG_15_53">Yes, I have heard it mentioned before. What is it?</string>
      <string id="CAPTAIN_TEXT_03">We could never... cross the threshold. What we saw was forbidden. Look at me! Forbidden…</string>
      <string id="DLG_18_00">It was too late to run or to forget…</string>
      <string id="DLG_19_00">It was too late to run or to forget…</string>
      <string id="AFTER_CAPTAIN">I must go back to East Hill and try to talk to Miss Konhe. If what the Captain said is true, she must have been one of them. She could know were to find them.</string>
      <string id="INT_CAPTAIN_DESC">It is Captain Skidd, no doubt. He is unconscious but he still breathes.</string>
      <string id="CAPTAIN_TEXT_01_00">As I imagined, you know nothing. Du Pré is not alone. He is but the peak of a pyramid, a vast group in which powerful people take part.</string>
      <string id="CAPTAIN_TEXT_01_01">A society acting in secret, ruled by a single sacred law: "see that no one knows".</string>
      <string id="CAPTAIN_TEXT_01_02">I was part of it. Du Pré himself recommended me.</string>
      <string id="CAPTAIN_TEXT_02_00">We gathered every month. What we saw… You cannot imagine.</string>
      <string id="CAPTAIN_TEXT_02_01">A curtain of normalcy protects the mind from… something… an outer something. The fog of the Veil protected us.</string>
      <string id="CAPTAIN_TEXT_02_02">But through the Veil we could peek out into the abyss… We could know of the unspeakable shapes that writhe beyond… A black nothingness, entirely full of horrors.</string>
      <string id="CAPTAIN_TEXT_03_00">We could never... cross the threshold. What we saw was forbidden. Look at me! Forbidden!</string>
      <string id="CAPTAIN_TEXT_03_01">I could not bear it any more, so I ran. I ran and I hid from them.</string>

      <string id="DLG_MIRRORGUARDIAN_02">Sergeant Conghill assured me that Du Pré was institutionalized here.</string>

      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_00">Excuse me, sir, I could not help but notice your uniform. Were you in the army?</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_01">Leave me alone. You do not want to talk to a coward such as myself.</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_02">Sir?</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_03">Leave me alone. I am just a coward.</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_04">This medal… I had one just like this, got it after the battles of Laing's Nek and Majuba Hill in… 1881. A decade ago now. 'For distinguished conduct in the field' it said. What a farce.</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_05">So you were in the army, as I thought? Allow me to introduce myself. I am Dr. Wakefield.</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_06">Sergeant William Conghill, Her Majesty's 6th Light Infantry. Are you another one of those alienists? Do you doctors not realize that cowardice cannot be cured by your arts?</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_07">Why are they keeping you here?</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_08">The doctors say I suffer from a "nervous disorder". I believe this is a term for when they themselves, with all their learning, do not know what to say. But I know the true name of my sickness. It is pure cowardice.</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_09">I am looking for a former patient of this hospital. You may have met him? His name is Alexandre Du Pré.</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_10">Yes, I did know a man by that name. We met briefly; he was here when I arrived.</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_11">What do you know about him?</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_12">He was a proper lad, educated. He listened closely to the stories of the other inmates but he kept his own to himself. We talked a lot. He was very close to Miss Konhe too. I think they got here at the same time. But when he left, he did so alone. I wonder what has become of him since.</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_13">Who is this Miss Konhe?</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_14">She is a patient here - the lady with a tempestuous character - you may have encountered her already. She has not been the same since Mr. Du Pré left, you know. She always sits to the side, alone and silent. I doubt you could talk to her at all, even if you tried. She... sees things, or at least she thinks she does.</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_15">What did you talk about, you and Mr. Du Pré?</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_16">We talked about my time in the south of Africa. I don't like to talk about that, but he somehow made me want to. He was persuasive.</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_17">He was very interested in one specific story, almost obsessive about it. He wanted to know every little detail.</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_18">Could you tell me that story? I'm trying to find a patient of mine who has gone missing, and this could be my only hope of finding him.</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_19">I don't like to relive those memories... A missing patient, you say? I... Alright. Maybe my story will be of some use then. It happened during the battle of Majuba Hill - I am sure you have heard of it - in March of '81.</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_20">The attack of the Boer army had taken us by surprise, and our regiment was forced to split up. We quickly found ourselves alone, just a few men lost on the barren plain… But I don't want to bore you.</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_21">No, sir, you certainly aren't. Please continue.</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_22">What had happened?</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_23">I never knew for certain. I didn't see anything… or if I did, my mind refused to bear such memories.</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_24">What happened to Captain Skidd?</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_25">When he finally regained consciousness… It was like someone else looked out at us through his eyes. I guess whatever happened affected him, changed him. I know he came back to London. Mr. Du Pré asked me of his whereabouts. Maybe he tried to contact him, to hear the rest of the story. He was quite preoccupied by it.</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_26">Hmmm. Do you know where I can find Captain Skidd?</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_27">The last I heard from fellow veterans, he had lost himself to a frenzy of alcohol, opium, and bad company. This downward spiral led him, as many others, to a wretched nadir: a dirty hole, deep in St. Giles Rookery, known as The Crimson Nest. Mayhap you will find him there. Alive even, if you are lucky.</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_28">Here, this is a picture of our regiment. You can see him there.</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_29">Sergeant Conghill?</string>
      <string id="DLG_SOLDIER_30">Please leave me be. Memories of war are painful. I don't want to remember them ever again.</string>
      <string id="DLG_07_44_00">Why are they keeping you here?</string>
      <string id="DLG_07_44_01">What do you know about him?</string>
      <string id="DLG_07_44_02">Who is this Miss Konhe?</string>
      <string id="DLG_07_44_03">What did you talk about, Mr. Du Pré and you?</string>
      <string comment="Choice 1" id="DLG_17_08_00">Maybe I could ask one of your senior colleagues?</string>
      <string comment="Choice 2" id="DLG_17_08_01">There are not many patients for an asylum of this size.</string>
      <string id="DLG_17_08_02">What is the matter with this patient?</string>
      <string id="DLG_17_08_03">I'll leave you with your work.</string>
      <string id="DLG_17_15">Well, apart from those in the isolation ward, it is true that there are not many patients at present, but there are even fewer of us caretakers now. We are only three for the whole hospital. For what I've been told, in the old times the income was enough to provide for everything we needed: a complete staff, proper accommodation for the patients, and the best doctors. But as the newer, bigger regional asylums were built, the Crown's support was gradually withdrawn from East Hill. Soon, everyone started leaving. And this is what remains.</string>
      <string comment="Q 1" id="DLG_17_11">Maybe one of your senior colleages could know something about this former patient?</string>
      <string id="DLG_17_16">Miss Konhe you mean? She has been here for a long time, even before I arrived. She has some kind of nervous condition, but the doctors have given up dicovering its cause. She also seems obsessed with certain subjects, such as ancient culture.</string>
      <string id="DLG_17_12">Well, you could ask Miss Riswell, in the entrance hall. She has been here for years, maybe for too long. You know we caretakers live here, with the patients, and we are not allowed to leave the asylum's premises. This life can get to you if you don't take proper care. I try to keep as much distance as possible from the lunatics...</string>
      <string id="DLG_17_14">This patient seems to have been deeply unsettled by my question. What condition does she suffer from?</string>
      <string id="DLG_17_13">The asylum is quite big, but I can't help noticing there aren't many patients around.</string>

      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_11">Oh sir, I am right sorry. I thought you knew. The Professor... he... he suffers from an ailment afflicting his brain. He is now entirely confined to his bed.</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_15">May I ask you something, Mrs. Oakwood?</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_16">Of course, Doctor.</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_17">How did the Professor become afflicted?</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_17_CH">How did the Professor become afflicted?</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_18">The ailment runs in his family. Mr Wright suffers from it, as did his father and grandmother before him.</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_19">Professor Wright mentioned something, a tale from his childhood. He called it “The tale of travels”. Do you know what would that be?</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_19_CH">Professor Wright mentioned a tale...</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_20">Oh, of course. You see, he often asks me to tell him this tale. You can read it in one of the books of the library.</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_21">Do you know if Professor Wright is fond of puzzles or riddles?</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_21_CH">Is Professor Wright fond of riddles?</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_22">Well, yes indeed. He has always been an enthusiast of every mind game you can think of. When his health was better he used to host themed soirees every other month.</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_23">Mrs. Oakwood, did the Professor ever work in the basement?</string>

      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_29">This ailment that runs in Professor Wright's family, do you know what its symptoms are?</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_29_CH">What are the symptoms of this illness?</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_30">Well, I can't speak those very long words physicians use. </string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_31">It is truly a terrible thing. And to think, all these years Mr. Wright knew what would become of him... May God have pity on his poor soul.</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_32">But I can tell you what I see in him. Professor Wright hardly remembers a thing from the last forty years. </string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_33">It is like he is a child again. With God's mercy it has now gone so far that it torments him no longer.</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPEr_BY_34">It is an easy find, Doctor. Look for the big book with the colourful cover.</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_35">He asked his guests to solve a make-believe mystery. Oh, to picture those gentlemen and ladies following clues all around the house and its premises, all night long...</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_36">Mr. Wright had some eccentric friends. But, as time has proven, their loyalty was scarce. Almost none of them have visited the master since.</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_37">Mr. Wright said... No, I... You must excuse me, Dr. Wakefield. I'm very busy right now.</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_4">Mrs Oakwood?</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_40">I am sorry, Dr. Wakefield. I must finish my work here. Have a good day.</string>

      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_45_CH">Is Professor Wright fond of riddles?</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_46">Why, yes, Doctor, I know that story well, I do indeed. He often asks me to read it to him. </string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_47">Indeed, yes! He has long been an enthusiast of every mind game you can imagine.</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_48">In better days, he would host parties every other month, "themed soirees" he called 'em. Oh those were good times.</string>

      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_5">Yes?  Who is it?</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_50">The book should be in the library.</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_6">Good morning, Mrs Oakwood.  Don't you remember me?</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_7">Why, Dr Kaufmann!  Bless my soul, it's been so long I hardly recognise you.  How nice to see you again.</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_8">Allow me to introduce my colleague Dr. John Wakefield. Is the Professor at home? We would like to see him.</string>
      <string id="DLG_HOUSEKEEPER_BY_9">Why yes, Doctor, of course, I am quite forgetting myself. Let me take you to him. It is really good of you to come. He receives so few visitors these days, on account of his condition.</string>

      <string id="DLG_BEDROOM_CTS22">He suffers from some kind of memory loss…</string>
      <string id="DLG_BEDROOM_CTS23">Yes. I am afraid he will not tell us much in this state.</string>
      <string id="DLG_BEDROOM_CTS24">If we could but stimulate his memories…</string>
      <string id="DLG_BEDROOM_CTS25">Maybe then he could tell us of his research. Something to unravel the mystery of the Playwright.</string>
      <string id="DLG_BEDROOM_CTS26">Perhaps. We have few other options in any case. Let us try.</string>
      <string id="DLG_BEDROOM_CTS27">Why don't you explore the Manor? There may some object we can use to jog the Professor's memory.</string>
      <string id="DLG_BEDROOM_CTS28">Meanwhile, I will try and talk to him about the time we researched together.</string>
      <string id="DLG_BEDROOM_CTS29">That could also help him remember...</string>
      <string id="DLG_BEDROOM_CTS30">Maybe we could help him remember...</string>

      <string id="DLG_KAUFFMAN_BR_28">Meanwhile, I will keep telling him about the years we spent researching together.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KAUFMANN_TIN_SOLDIER_1">This tin soldier appears to commemorate a military campaign. Perhaps it could jog the Professor's memories?</string>
      <string id="DLG_KAUFMANN_TIN_SOLDIER_2">Yes, this could work, mein Freund. Why don't you show it to him?</string>
      <string id="DLG_KAUFMANN_TIN_SOLDIER_3">Yes, this could work, mein Freund. Why don't you show it to him?</string>
      <string id="DLG_MENTOR_SOLDIER_6">Sergeant Downing was sent to the front. The man that returned was not Sergeant Downing.</string>
      <string id="DLG_MENTOR_SOLDIER_7">It is properly hidden. Concealed... but he will find it, I have no doubt.</string>
      <string id="DLG_MENTOR_SOLDIER_8">Your visitor? What do you mean, Professor?</string>
      <string id="DLG_MENTOR_SOLDIER_9">My dearest visitor. He will know where to look. Oh, what a time we will have!</string>
      <string id="DLG_MENTOR_SOLDIER_10">He will have seen the map. And he will know The Book of Travels.</string>
      <string id="DLG_MENTOR_SOLDIER_11">The Book of Travels?</string>
      <string id="DLG_MENTOR_SOLDIER_12">Yes yes, he will work it out. But it must not be too easy, no. But he will find the prize, I am sure.</string>
      <string id="DLG_MENTOR_DEFAULT_7">My dearest visitor will find the prize.</string>
      <string id="DLG_MENTOR_SOLDIER_13">Prize...? What on earth is he talking about Kaufmann?</string>
      <string id="DLG_MENTOR_SOLDIER_14">Something concealed... something precious. In his addled state, could he have hidden away parts of his research?</string>
      <string id="DLG_MENTOR_SOLDIER_15">Hmmm. He was always a proud man. He would not easily have forgotten his most ground-breaking work.

      <string id="DLG_DRUNK_6">Because of the hat you are wearing.</string>
      <string id="DLG_DRUNK_6_CH">Your hat.</string>
      <string id="DLG_WAITRESS_4">Church? Let me give you some advice. Barmaids ain't the people to ask about church opening hours. This here bar is my church. Most of the village've come to see things my way too. We prays here these days.</string>

      <string id="DLG_WAITRESS_12">Do you know when will the church open?</string>
      <string id="DLG_WAITRESS_6">The whole village has forsaken the church? But why?</string>
      <string id="DLG_WAITRESS_7">The town is forsaken. No work on the coasts these days, see? Few can make a living. Most of the fishers and sailors have up and left. Half the cottages lie abandoned. Those who stayed, they barely leave their homes, 'cept to come here of course. </string>

      <string id="DLG_WAITRESS_15">Weeell, there's rumours. Silly stories if you asks me, but some take 'em real serious. Fishers, big dependable guys, they'll tell you they've seen stuff out there on the water, apparitions, shapes among the rocks. I say it's the booze talking, and I should know. Who could see anything in all that mist anyway? But fishers, they're superstitious. Folk believed the tales and one by one they just didn't come home no more. </string>

      <string id="DLG_WAITRESS_22">Have you ever met Professor Wright? </string>
      <string id="DLG_WAITRESS_29">The Professor? Sure. Saw him every other day as a young'un. Always involved in the village. He was la-di-dah alright but folk respected him. He got stuck in. Didn't last, though. Shut himself away, started getting visitors from out of town. He stopped coming to the village eventually. Last I heard, he'd gone crazy. None of us knows for sure though.

      <string id="DLG_DRUNK_20">I love the sea more than anything! It is my passion, my freedom and my life.</string>

      <string id="DLG_DRUNK_26">What did you understand?</string>
      <string id="DLG_DRUNK_29">I understood there was no more freedom for me. That the sea now had other lords.</string>
      <string id="DLG_DRUNK_27_CH">What happened then?</string>
      <string id="DLG_DRUNK_30">As I navigated back to shore, I lost control of my ship in a great storm. The rocks of the cliffs did the rest.</string>
      <string id="DLG_DRUNK_28_CH">I will leave you alone.</string>
      <string id="DLG_DRUNK_28">I will leave you alone to your thoughts.</string>

      <string id="DLG_DRUNK_42">But there are many things about Him that we do not know. There are, far from the coast, in the deep dark, things we are still unprepared to behold.</string>
      <string id="DLG_DRUNK_43">Believe me, those things await deep down.</string>
      <string id="DLG_DRUNK_44">You may have heard one or two of the stories the fishermen tell, about things seen out there.</string>
      <string id="DLG_DRUNK_45">It is nought but tales for young'uns, mere superstition from men too cowardly to face the dark. Any good seaman knows that in the strong wind, a stretched rope can shake and sing.</string>
      <string id="DLG_DRUNK_46">I, myself, have mistaken such keening for the wail of a child. But there was one time... one time it was nothing of the sort. Then, the Sea howled.</string>
      <string id="DLG_DRUNK_47">It was not thunder, not a strong wave clashing with my ship. No.</string>
      <string id="DLG_DRUNK_48">It was like a voice... It spoke to me in a language I cannot describe. A sound muttered by a living something, a call unlike anything I had heard before.</string>
      <string id="DLG_DRUNK_49">I do not know where the remains of my dear Augustine ended up, with the passing of years and tides. I looked for them, once, for many moons, but all I found was this bar and the bottom of an empty glass. I have never returned to the shore since. May she forgive me.</string>
      <string id="DLG_DRUNK_50">Now, leave me be.</string>
      <string id="DLG_DRUNK_51">And whoever they were, I did know they would not share it.</string>

You must find this place, mein Freund.

      <string id="DLG_KEEPER1">Good evening. Would you happen to be the lighthouse keeper?</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER2">My name is Wakefield.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_3">A stranger… And what would he want from me?</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_6">I am a visitor to Éilís Mór. This lighthouse caught my eye.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_7">And since it's dark, you thought it to be abandoned?</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_8">Well, it's not. Even though I can barely see a thing, this is my house.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_5">I was taking a stroll, and I fear I got lost.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_9">I understand. After sunset, the hills of Éilís Mór can be tricky. We have a saying here: 'In dusk, all paths change.'</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_10">If you stand at the apex of that hill, over there, past the rocks, you will see the lights of the village.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_12_CH">Why is the lamp not lit? </string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_6_CH">I am visiting the island. </string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_5_CH">I got lost.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_12">Why is the lighthouse lamp not lit? Is it not dangerous for the ships?</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_14">Do not let it concern you. Many years ago, the sea lanes were altered to avoid this coast. Now it's rare indeed to see a ship in these waters. After the accident, the lighthouse was never repaired.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_16_CH">Was there a failure in the mechanism?</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_16">Was there a failure in the lamp's mechanism?</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_17">Precisely that. One stormy afternoon, I suddenly heard a strong noise up in the lightroom. The clockwork mechanism had stopped working and the lamp was off! I had never seen a failure like that. I could not get the lighthouse working again.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_19">I was checking the lenses, because the failure looked so very strange and I was worried. All of a sudden, the light must have turned on; I was blinded and can see nothing but fleeting shapes ever since.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_18_CH">An accident?</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_18">You say you had an accident? What happened?</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_20_CH">And the lamp has not been fixed since?</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_20">Has nobody else tried to fix the lamp since?</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_21">No, no one in the village is interested. For them, the more isolated Éilís Mór is the better. They do not care about ships or accidents, especially Lord Donnán. He sees anything coming from outside of the island as a threat.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_13_CH">Do you know Lord Donnán?</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_13">Do you know Lord Donnán personally?</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_22">Naturally! The Donnán family has ruled Éilís Mór for generations.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_23_CH">I would like to visit the lightroom anyway.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_23">Might I go upstairs and see the lightroom? Even though the lamp is off, I should like to take a view of the surrounding countryside.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_24">Well, I do not think you will see anything, really. But if you are so interested... Yes, I guess you may.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_25_CH">I see.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_25">I understand. </string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_26_CH">I must go.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_26">Thank you for the pleasant conversation. I must go.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_30">It cannot be! I never thought I would hear the rhythm of my beloved lighthouse working again.</string>

      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_39">Do you know anything about the disappearance of Lord Donnán's son?</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_45">A tragedy, it was. A strange one, but a tragedy nonetheless.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_46">I just find it a bit suspicious that it happened so close to the Reunion. It’s too easy to be keeping secrets during the festival, being how everyone is afraid of leaving the village those nights.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_47">What do you mean?</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_48">Look, folks here are too gullible. They’ll do anything to protect themselves from their strange fears. They’ll not eat corn, nor drink milk, or they'll dig graves for their mirrors. And of course, they’ll avoid standing near a fearnóg too long because, though the fiends cannot touch the tree, they're attracted to the smell of its resin.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_49">But surely it’s all nonsense! Look, it’s really easy to prove it all wrong: just don’t follow the rituals. You’re a stranger to our ways, but have you seen any of the things I mentioned?</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_50">Well, I did see a group of people in the village burying mirrors.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_51">Exactly! What do you think would happen if you unburied those mirrors? That a band of goblins would come out of the marshes to steal them? Nothing but nonsense.</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_41_CH">What of Kieran's disappearance?</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_41">What of Kieran's disappearance, then?</string>
      <string id="DLG_KEEPER_44">Well, I’ll admit I’m not sure what happened to the boy... But one thing I am sure of: this 'Festival of Reunion' is nothing but a farce. And it would be just so easy to prove it...</string>

      <string id="DLG_FIRST_CONVERSATION_1">Well, Dr Wakefield. You are here on holiday, then?</string>
      <string id="DLG_FIRST_CONVERSATION_2">Yes, indeed. I have come to enjoy a rest somewhere far from the stresses of city life.</string>
      <string id="DLG_FIRST_CONVERSATION_3">I see.</string>
      <string id="DLG_FIRST_CONVERSATION_4">Well, if it’s distractions you’ve come looking for, you’ve chosen the right time of year for it. These days we celebrate a very special tradition of our kin. Something unique.</string>
      <string id="DLG_FIRST_CONVERSATION_8">We call it the Festival of Reunion.</string>
      <string id="DLG_FIRST_CONVERSATION_5">Fascinating. May I ask, what does it entail?</string>
      <string id="DLG_FIRST_CONVERSATION_6">According to tradition, for the next three nights, the spirits of Reunion leave the confines of the Other Side and roam the hills of Éilís Mór. We wear costumes and masks so that the spirits will not recognise us and make us the targets of their mischief. Certain rites take place, too…</string>
      <string id="DLG_FIRST_CONVERSATION_7">…But I should not bore you with the details. You shall have occasion to see for yourself.</string>
      <string id="WINDOW_INSPECT">An odd mosaic adorns the floor. It depicts two snakes biting each other.</string>
      <string id="DLG_PARLOUR_QUESTIONS_2_CH">Engraved panels.</string>
      <string id="DLG_PARLOUR_QUESTIONS_2">Do these panels on the wall represent a classical theme? I cannot seem to place it.</string>
      <string id="DLG_PARLOUR_QUESTIONS_4">They are the panels of the first king of Éilís Mór. In the days of the druids, we worshipped the great god Lugh, and our kings did right by those beliefs.</string>
      <string id="DLG_PARLOUR_QUESTIONS_3_CH">Snakes mosaic.</string>
      <string id="DLG_PARLOUR_QUESTIONS_3">Well, I… I cannot help noticing this remarkable mosaic. It looks authentic.</string>
      <string id="DLG_PARLOUR_QUESTIONS_5">Yes, it is. Although some historians might disagree, we believe that this manor was built atop an ancient Roman villa. In our traditions, the double serpent represents a sentinel that protects us from the terrible threat hidden within itself.</string>
      <string id="DLG_PARLOUR_QUESTIONS_6_CH">Thank you for your invitation.</string>
      <string id="DLG_PARLOUR_QUESTIONS_6">My sincere thanks for your warm welcome.</string>
      <string id="DLG_PARLOUR_QUESTIONS_7">You need not thank me. I simply observe our traditions.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_37">You seem to be knowledgeable about Éilís Mór's folklore. I should very much like to learn about the island's history in more detail.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_36">It is true that we in Éilís Mór cleave to the ancient traditions. We haven’t lost touch like some of those on the mainland. But I am no expert. If you are really interested, you should talk to Miss Foster.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_11">Please forgive my indiscretion, but do you consider yourself a religious man, Dr Wakefield?</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_14_CH">No.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_14">No, I do not.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_13_CH">Yes.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_13">Yes, I do.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_18">You seem so certain. Might I ask why?</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_15">You seem so certain. Might I ask why?</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_20_CH">I am a man of science.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_20">My only faith is the belief that all phenomena can be explained through rational inquiry.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_30">Everything else is mere superstition, a result of fear of the unknown.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_21_CH">Religion means nothing to me.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_21">As a scholar of the human mind, I consider religions to be nothing more than social artifacts that are designed to influence ideologies.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_29">Nevertheless, I have come to understand that reality sometimes overcomes our ability to understand it.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_22_CH">I am not a man of faith.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_22">I have not yet found a religion that provides the answers I seek.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_24_CH">I have been educated in faith.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_24">Do not get me wrong, I am a man of science. But during my upbringing, the Lord's word was a constant.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_25_CH">There must be an Unmoved Mover.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_25">I consider myself to be a man of science, but some phenomena can be explained only by the existence of an Unmoved Mover.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_26_CH">I am not sure.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_26">I had a religious upbringing, but my experience as a psychiatrist has led me to doubt certain tenets of faith.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_34">I see.</string>
      <string id="DLG_LORD_PARLOUR_35">Let us take a walk by the lake. From there we can see the beauty of the island as we talk, and be the better for it.</string>
      <string id="DECO_STATUE">A large statue of a person. It is so eroded by the passage of time, it is difficult to tell any specific detail.</string>

      <string id="DLG_PARLOUR_QUESTIONS_13_CH">The statue.</string>
      <string id="DLG_PARLOUR_QUESTIONS_13">The statue is remarkable. May I ask what it represents?</string>

It is customary in Éilís Mór to welcome strangers with hospitality. I should be honoured if you would accept this invitation to join me at my manor for dinner and amiable conversation.

Your new friend,
Lord Donnán</string>
      <string id="ARRIVAL_THINK_1">Éilís Mór.</string>
      <string id="ARRIVAL_THINK_2">According to Kaufmann's letter, the legendary Cronemeadan can be found here.</string>

      <string id="DLG_BURNTHOUSE8">They say a villager defied it and the next day her house was burned to the ground.</string>

      <string id="DLG_ARTISTKID14">A symbol? What does it mean?</string>
      <string id="DLG_ARTISTKID15">It's the final truth that’ll protect us from the marsh dwellers. But we're not allowed to say its name out loud.</string>
      <string id="DLG_ARTISTKID17_CH">I must go.</string>

      <string id="DLG_DRAWING_OPTION_2_1">Is this the village?</string>
      <string id="DLG_DRAWING_OPTION_2_2">Yes, and the fearnóg tree in the graveyard. That tree gives me the chills these nights. On Reunion they got them little lanterns on it and they look like evil eyes staring into you.</string>
      <string id="DLG_DRAWING_OPTION_3_1">What about these buildings?</string>
      <string id="DLG_DRAWING_OPTION_3_2">Don’t know. Never seen them before.</string>

      <string id="DLG_ARTISTKID4">I found this drawing at the school. Is it yours?</string>
      <string id="DLG_TAW_ROCKSHILL_1">The marsh in this valley is, for simpletons, a wellspring of frightful tales.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TAW_ROCKSHILL_4">The educated among us enjoy the tales as little more than distractions, knowing us safe from those visions. We know these stories to be nothing but superstition.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TAW_ROCKSHILL_5">But how can we be so sure that in the dense mist that emanates from the stagnant water, we may not find passages to other worlds?</string>
      <string id="DLG_TAW_ROCKSHILL_6">What if the wails that drift from the reeds in the darkest of nights are the songs of those from our worst nightmares?</string>
      <string id="DLG_ARTISTKID21_CH">The marsh dwellers.</string>
      <string id="DLG_ARTISTKID21">The marsh dwellers? Who are they?</string>
      <string id="DLG_ARTISTKID22">They’re scary. My Aunt Kathleen says they were really bad people. You’d never see them, but you’d hear them in the reeds. They try to take you in there with them.</string>
      <string id="DLG_ARTISTKID24">That? It's a map that Kieran made.</string>
      <string id="DLG_ARTISTKID25">So it is a map…</string>
      <string id="DLG_ARTISTKID26">The drawing is Kieran's? There could be a clue here of his whereabouts…</string>

      <string id="DLG_ARTISTKID27">Were you Kieran's friend?</string>
      <string id="DLG_ARTISTKID28">He was nice, but he didn’t want to play much. He was mostly for going in the hills by himself.</string>
      <string id="DLG_ARTISTKID29_CH">Was Kieran not afraid?</string>
      <string id="DLG_ARTISTKID29">Was Kieran not scared of the marsh dwellers?</string>
      <string id="DLG_ARTISTKID31">No, he said he had seen them and that they were not as scary as Aunt says. I think that is why they took him.</string>
      <string id="DLG_ARTISTKID32">You think the marsh dwellers took him?</string>
      <string id="DLG_ARTISTKID33">Yes, for sure. Before he disappeared he said he found a treasure, a disc with a beautiful drawing.</string>
      <string id="DLG_ARTISTKID35">That's why we can't come here alone. We always have to take someone with us.</string>
      <string id="STICK_INSPECT">The child that I spoke with earlier seems to have left his mask here. There's a ribbon hanging from it.</string>
      <string id="STICK2_INSPECT">The child that I spoke with earlier seems to have left his mask here. The ribbon has flown away.</string>
      <string id="DLG_ARTISTKID36">He took it from the old house in the hills. Maybe the marsh dwellers wanted it.</string>

      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_14">Well, it takes place when the constellation Reunion is visible in the sky. On those nights, dark things and spirits ride the winds that travel across the hills. As you may have already seen, at sunset the villagers don masks. They do this so that the spirits will not know them or carry them away to the depths of their underground caves.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_19_CH">I must go.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_19">I must leave now. It has been a pleasure.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_20">The pleasure was mine. Enjoy your time on Éilís Mór.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_45">Céad míle fáilte, Dr Wakefield. Welcome to Éilís Mór.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_22_CH">What happened?</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_22">Did something happen a few weeks ago?</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_24">Oh, sure it was truly terrible. Kieran, his only child, disappeared without a trace. He went off to play in the hills and just... vanished. No one has seen him since.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_30">Good Lord. And you say he has not been found yet? How is that possible?</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_26_CH">Tell me about Kieran.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_26">What can you tell me about Kieran's disappearance?</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_27">Just that he was a restless child who loved exploring deserted areas. You might learn more from his classmates.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_46">His desk was in the back corner.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_31">Yes, of course.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_32">Do you know the meaning of the word 'Cronemeadan'?</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_33">Yes… It's a very unusual word. Very much indeed.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_34">The Cronemeadan is the sanctuary of the Crooked One. It is a cursed place, the dwelling of the Devil. I recall it from the tales that I heard as a child. Of course, our elders only made up those tales to scare us and protect us from harm.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_36_CH">Please tell me the story.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_36">Would you tell me the story of the Cronemeadan?</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_37">All right.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_38">There’s a hole in the ground up in the hills, not too far from the village. A hole so dark and deep, you’d not see the end.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_39">Folks around here believe there lies an old serpent at its depths – ravenous for flesh. The Crooked One.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_40">Long ago, our ancestors threw livestock into the pit in the hope of placating the Crooked One's hunger. Though that tradition has not been practiced for some time, so perhaps it would be best if you did not approach the hole.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_41">It is said that the last heir of the Laidcend once defied the Crooked One by approaching the rim with an iron amulet in her hand.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_47">It is general knowledge that beings from the Other Side detest iron, so the cursing and the shouting of the young Laidcend received no immediate answer.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_48">But a few nights later, the Laidcend house was consumed in a horrific blaze, putting an end to the old family.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_43_CH">People at the graveyard.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_43">There was a group of masked people at the graveyard. Was that part of the festival?</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_44">Yes, that was one of the first rites of the Reunion, a very important one. As I said, people dress up to protect themselves from those that will come. But this is not enough. Since the mirrors they have looked into while changing know their identities, they bury them next to the old fearnóg. The roots of this tree grow in both worlds at the same time, so they keep the witness mirrors safe.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_51_CH">Éilís Mór's traditions.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_51">Lord Donnán said you are an expert on the island's folklore.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_52">He said that, did he? Well I wouldn’t call myself an expert, now, but I’ve lived here in Éilís Mór longer than most. And I’ve heard my fair share of stories about the Other Side and its people.</string>
      <string id="DECO_WINDOWS">The windows are open, letting a chilly draft inside.</string>
      <string id="DECO_BOOKSHELF">A shelf of handmade books with unfamiliar titles. Most of them concern strange rites.</string>
      <string id="DECO_BLACKBOARD">'They'll dance around the burrow,
Around the burrow they'll sing.
It's cold inside as winter.
Don't get too close!
Don't get too close!
Or else they'll pull you in.'</string>
      <string id="DESK_REACT">There is some kind of worm screw inside, the remains of an insect beside it, and some drawings engraved on the desk. I will take the drive with me. It may prove itself useful.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_PICTURE_1">I found this picture. Was it made by one of your students?</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_PICTURE2">Yes... This was painted by poor Kieran.</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_PICTURE3">What would you say it represents?</string>
      <string id="DLG_TEACHER_PICTURE4">Things that were familiar to him... the village, his home... but these other shapes... I do not know. You could ask one of his classmates. They should be able to tell you more about it.</string>
      <string id="CTS_MIRROR_BROKEN">What... was that?</string>

      <string id="INTRO_TEXT_1">We left the black waves of that sea behind and walked through the mist.</string>
      <string id="INTRO_TEXT_2">At times, gusts of wind parted the mist, revealing a barren landscape under a dying sun.</string>
      <string id="INTRO_TEXT_3">At first, I could not contain my many questions. But Devitt's only reply was a grave silence. Eventually, I lapsed into an uneasy quiet and resolved to follow my patient, I knew not where.</string>
      <string id="INTRO_TEXT_4">We wandered through the vast desert without any apparent goal. On occasion, vague shapes appeared in the distance - crumbling towers and abandoned cities, lost amongst the rippling dunes.</string>
      <string id="INTRO_TEXT_5">The passage of time lost its meaning. I had traversed that world all my life. All the world's life. Our journey was eternity.</string>
      <string id="INTRO_TEXT_6">Then, the man at my side - whom I had followed so long - stopped. He spoke for the first time.</string>
      <string id="INTRO_TEXT_7">“We are nearing the Threshold.”</string>
      <string id="INTRO_TEXT_8">“It is the starting point, Doctor. The first place to look. I will be waiting on the other side.”</string>
      <string id="INTRO_TEXT_9">“Remember this: I will not be here forever. Darkness will light your way. But then, you will be alone.”</string>
      <string id="INTRO_TEXT_10">I opened my mouth to reply but he had already turned and disappeared into the mist. I stood and stared after him, and then I kept walking. I did not know what else to do.</string>

      <string id="DLG_FINAL_1_41_CH">How did I get to this place?</string>
      <string id="DLG_FINAL_1_41">I was in that pit, in Éilís Mór, when suddenly...  I found Devitt, but he disappeared. I journeyed through the fog and found myself here. But how is this possible?</string>
      <string id="DLG_FINAL_1_43">Ale-ish-more... I do not know that name. Many paths in our world lead to this place, Doctor Wakefield, and I know only a few. In some of Zha'ilathal's mirrors you see the Truth leaking into our world... and in others, you see yourself.</string>
      <string id="DLG_FINAL_1_44">I knew you would reach us at last. He was certain of it.</string>
      <string id="DLG_FINAL_1_42_CH">We looked for you.</string>
      <string id="DLG_FINAL_1_42">We looked for you... Kaufmann and I. </string>

      <string id="DLG_FINAL_1_49">He?</string>
      <string id="DLG_FINAL_1_50">The First Founder of the Order. The Artifex. Do you not yet know his name?</string>
      <string id="MONOLOGUE_1">Yes, Jeremiah gathered us all under the same rule.</string>
      <string id="MONOLOGUE_2">“Videte ne quis sciat.”  See that no one knows.</string>
      <string id="MONOLOGUE_3">We knew of the Final Truth which lay beyond the Threshold.</string>
      <string id="MONOLOGUE_4">This is what the Playwright was committed to finding. This was Jeremiah's obsession.</string>
      <string id="MONOLOGUE_5">The First Language, which is said to grant the power of creation.</string>
      <string id="MONOLOGUE_6">After our experiment at school, we realized that the path of the ancient ones was watched by a fearsome guardian.</string>
      <string id="MONOLOGUE_7">We needed a way to circumvent the inexorable gaze of the Bird. I found Captain Skidd, who had met the Bird and lived. We decided to use him in a test.</string>
      <string id="MONOLOGUE_8">It was a catastrophe. We eventually found the survivors, but their memories were... incomplete. Jeremiah had fared the worst. He had been left devoid of any memories that were related to our efforts.</string>
      <string id="MONOLOGUE_9">We were desperate to find a solution. Hugo tried, and failed. And then, Anthony and I miraculously came across a formula that had lain forgotten for centuries.</string>
      <string id="DLG_FINAL_2_35">At last, it was time to bring Jeremiah back into our ranks. That was nearly a disaster as well. I did not anticipate Anthony's sudden madness... or the extent of Father Ernest's decline. Mercifully, Jeremiah's life was spared.</string>
      <string id="DLG_FINAL_2_36">But something else was wrong.</string>
      <string id="DLG_FINAL_2_37">When Jeremiah reached me, he did not remember everything. He had changed. He told me that he was going to put an end to all of this.</string>
      <string id="DLG_FINAL_2_38">He still means to acquire the First Language. But he wants to use it to ruin our work!</string>
      <string id="DLG_FINAL_2_39">He has already crossed the Threshold... Once he learns the Final Truth, none of this will ever have existed: the Order, the Door, or ourselves!</string>
      <string id="DLG_FINAL_2_40">You must stop him, Doctor. You must stop him before the Curtain closes forever!</string>
      <string id="DLG_FINAL_FAIL1">The moment has passed. Now it is too late. We are doomed.</string>
      <string id="DLG_FINAL_ALEXANDRE_1_1">There is no time. You must decide!</string>

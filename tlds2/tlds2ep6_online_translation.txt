ep6_innroom	LG_KAUFFMAN_IR41	I agree. The horror he experienced at the end of the session was far too intense to derive solely from his imagination. It speaks of some trauma.	我同意。他在临交流结束前体验到的极大恐惧不可能单单来自于想象。这是某种创伤的后遗症。

ep6_innroom	LG_KAUFFMAN_IR60	My dear Wakefield, what advice can I offer? A church would not remain closed all day. If you must wait, then do so, and in the meantime talk to the villagers.

During the session, the Professor said that the entrance to the tunnel was through "a waterfall not of water but of rocks and mud". It is too close to be a coincidence!	不好意思，威克菲尔德，答案不是已经很明显了吗？在谈话中，教授说隧道的入口在“由岩石和泥土而非清水组成的瀑布中”。这不可能只是个巧合！
ep6_innroom	LG_KAUFFMAN_IR65	I theorize that the entrance to the tunnel is concealed somewhere in that house.	我猜隧道的入口隐藏在房子里的某个地方。

ep6_innroom	LG_DWAYNE_18	Doctor, this is far from my specialty, but... Do you think it could be something more serious?	医生，这不是我的专业，但是……这有没有可能是更严重的疾病？
ep6_innroom	LG_DWAYNE_18_CH	Could it be something serious?	有没有可能是更严重的疾病？

ep6_library	GLOBE_REACT	There is a sealed letter inside.	里面有一封封住的信件。
ep6_library	FRONTYARD_DOOR_OPENS	The door has been opened...	门开了……
ep6_libraryConversation	LG_LIBRARYCONVERSATION16	Not at all. That would be of no elegance whatsoever!	不是，那样的话太不优雅了！
ep6_libraryConversation	LG_LIBRARYCONVERSATION1	You see, Mr Wright, our organization is keenly interested in your research.	莱特先生，如你所见，我们的组织对你的研究十分感兴趣。
ep6_libraryConversation	LG_LIBRARYCONVERSATION2	We could reach an agreement to fund this project.	我们愿意资助这个项目。
ep6_libraryConversation			
ep6_libraryConversation	LG_LIBRARYCONVERSATION3	But first we need to know the details.	但是我们要先得知研究的细节。
ep6_libraryConversation	LG_LIBRARYCONVERSATION4	I understand.	我明白了。
ep6_libraryConversation	LG_LIBRARYCONVERSATION5	The main factor is the condition of the test subject; how open he is to suggestion. As you know, only the human mind can open a physical passage to the other side.	主要的因素是实验对象的状态，即他接受暗示的能力，因为只有人类的思想才能打开通向另一边的道路。
ep6_libraryConversation	LG_LIBRARYCONVERSATION6	So a complete, absolute darkness will be required for the experience to result. A secluded place, completely isolated.	所以，为了得到研究成果，必须要有一个完全且绝对黑暗的环境。一个封闭的、与世隔绝的空间。
ep6_libraryConversation	LG_LIBRARYCONVERSATION7	A place that can only bring thoughts of what may be hiding in the dark.	那个地方只能让人的脑海里满是隐藏在黑暗中的未知物体。
ep6_libraryConversation	LG_LIBRARYCONVERSATION8	But in total darkness and seclusion, how could the results of the experiment be studied or confirmed?	但是在完全黑暗且隔离的环境下如何观测、研究、确认实验成果呢？
ep6_libraryConversation	LG_LIBRARYCONVERSATION9	That is precisely where your organization can provide help.	这就是你们的组织能帮上忙的地方。
ep6_libraryConversation	LG_LIBRARYCONVERSATION10	I have designed a special device that would allow me to listen from a safe distance. But I lack the means to manufacture it myself.	我设计了一个特殊装置，使我在安全距离外监控。但我无法制造它。
ep6_libraryConversation	LG_LIBRARYCONVERSATION11	That we could arrange.	我们可以安排一下。
ep6_libraryConversation	LG_LIBRARYCONVERSATION12	But there is one last thing I would like to know.	但我想问最后一件事。
ep6_libraryConversation	LG_LIBRARYCONVERSATION13	How would the... experience be triggered?	如何触发那种……体验？
ep6_libraryConversation	LG_LIBRARYCONVERSATION14	By means of a chemical compound of some kind?	通过某种化学合成物质？
ep6_libraryConversation	LG_LIBRARYCONVERSATION15	Do you mean a serum?	你是说血清吗？
ep6_libraryConversation	LG_LIBRARYCONVERSATION17	The trigger is the mind itself. The emotion known as terror.	触发的关键在于人心本身，名为恐惧的情感。
ep6_libraryConversation	LG_LIBRARYCONVERSATION18	The primal fear that still survives in the depths of our mind, from the times humans were mere beasts.	原初的恐惧仍潜藏在我们心灵的深处，从人类还是野兽的时候就存在的恐惧。
ep6_libraryConversation	LG_LIBRARYCONVERSATION19	That which allows us to open a physical passage beyond the Veil of rational thought.	这能使我们打开一条越过理性思维的帷幕的实体通道。
ep6_libraryConversation	LG_LIBRARYCONVERSATION20	Primal terror is the key that we will use to open the Last Door.	原初恐惧是我们打开最后一扇门的钥匙。
ep6_libraryConversation	NITIAL_TEXT	Today, a meeting finally took place	今天，那个会议就要开始了

ep6_maze	MAZE_BONES_DESC	These are... human remains. The flesh is gone, but the bones look undisturbed. How long have they lain here? Why on earth did Professor Wright not alert the authorities? I must press on. What possible "research" could have led to this?	这些是……人类骨骸。肌肉都已经腐烂了，但是白骨依旧保持原状。它们留在这里多久了？为什么莱特教授没有警告当地权威？我必须继续前进。究竟是什么样的“研究”能导致这种结果？
ep6_maze	MAZE_HOLE_DESC	The hole goes deep into the wall of the cave...	洞穴的岩壁上又有一个深深的洞口……

ep6_maze	ECO_BRICK	Part of the wall's stones seem to have just dislodged from it, leaving a large, dark hole on it.	好像墙的一部分被移开了，留下了一个巨大、黑暗的洞穴。
ep6_maze	ARCHWAY_NOTES1	Who was gone will be back not the same, but somehow changed. Because that what lurks behind the Door, waits. And no one that has crossed through can hope to escape its blessing.	离去之人回归时不会保持原状，他们总会在某种意义上改变。因为蛰伏在门后的存在一直在等待。没有人能在穿越界限后能逃脱它的祝福。

Just as you, a stranger, have brought me to my lost treasure, may this old sailor's spyglass, in whatever way it can, help light the way to yours. Take it: it is a gift from the heart.	先生，我无法言表你为这个醉鬼所做的事情的感激之情。你，一个陌生人，帮我找回我早已失落的宝藏。希望这只老水手的望远镜，能以某种方式帮助你。小小心意，请您收下。

ep6_pub	LG_WAITRESS_29	The Professor? Sure. Saw him every other day as a young'un. Always involved in the village. He was la-di-dah alright but folk respected him. He got stuck in. Didn't last, though. Shut himself away, started getting visitors from out of town. He stopped coming to the village eventually. Last I heard, he'd gone crazy. None of us knows for sure though. Been years since I saw him.	教授？当然。他年轻时我隔三差五就能见到他。他对镇子里的各类活动都很热心。他看上去装模作样，但是同乡们都很敬重他。他热火朝天地和同乡打着交道。但是好景不长啊。之后他开始把自己封闭在自己家里，不断有镇外的人来拜访。最终，他甚至都不来镇上了。最近我听说他疯了。但是没人敢把话说满了。我上次见到他可是好几年前了。

ep6_pub	LG_DRUNK_27_CH	What happened then?	发生了什么？
ep6_pub	LG_DRUNK_30	As I navigated back to shore, I lost control of my ship in a great storm. The rocks of the cliffs did the rest.	当我航行到岸边时，我的船在一场巨大的风暴中失控了。悬崖上的岩石把我的船彻底摧毁了。

ep6_pub	LG_DRUNK_41	Indeed I have. Good Hope, Leeuwin and Horn. Therefore I hold the right to stand before kings, and to piss against the wind.	确实如此。好望角、卢因角与合恩角。所以我拥有站在国王面前的权利，还有迎风撒尿的权利。
ep6_pub	LG_DRUNK_42	But there are many things about Him that we do not know. There are, far from the coast, in the deep dark, things we are still unprepared to behold.	但是我们对于“他”还有很多东西不了解。远离海滩，在黑暗的深处，我们还没有准备好接受的东西。
ep6_pub	LG_DRUNK_43	Believe me, those things await deep down.	相信我，那些东西在深处等着我们。
ep6_pub	LG_DRUNK_44	You may have heard one or two of the stories the fishermen tell, about things seen out there.	你可能听过几个渔夫讲的关于在海上见到的东西的故事。

ep6_pub	LG_DRUNK_46	I, myself, have mistaken such keening for the wail of a child. But there was one time... one time, it was nothing of the sort. Then, the Sea howled.	我自己曾经也为如此类似婴儿的哭声困扰过。但是有一次……有一次，和之前完全不一样。那一次，海洋都在咆哮。
ep6_pub	LG_DRUNK_47	It was not thunder, not a strong wave clashing with my ship. No.	那不是雷声，更不是海浪拍打着我的船舷。不是。
ep6_pub	LG_DRUNK_48	It was like a voice... It spoke to me in a language I cannot describe. A sound muttered by a living something, a call unlike anything I had heard before.	那是一个声音……它用不知名的语言和我对话。一个活物发出的声音，我之前从未听过的呼唤。
ep6_pub	LG_DRUNK_49	I do not know where the remains of my dear Augustine ended up, with the passing of years and tides. I looked for them, once, for many moons, but all I found was this bar and the bottom of an empty glass. I have never returned to the shore since. May she forgive me.	我不知道我亲爱的奥古斯丁的残骸随着时间与波涛去了哪里。我曾经连续数月寻找她，但我只找到了这间酒吧和空空的酒杯。我再也没有回到海岸边。希望它能原谅我。
ep6_pub	LG_DRUNK_50	Now, leave me be.	现在，让我一个人静静。
ep6_pub	LG_DRUNK_51	And whoever they were, I did know they would not share it.	无论他们是谁，我知道他们不会分享任何东西的。
ep6_pub	LG_DRUNK_52	I thought I would never see it again! I will clean it and make it shine anew.	我以为我再也见不到她了！我要仔细地清洁她，让她焕然一新。
